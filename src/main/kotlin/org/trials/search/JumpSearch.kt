/**
 * Jump search (also known as block search) is an algorithm for finding the
 * position of an element in a sorted array. Unlike linear search, it doesn't
 * compare each element of an array with the target value. Instead, to find a
 * value, the array is represented as a sequence of blocks.
 *
 * The time complexity is O(âˆšn).
